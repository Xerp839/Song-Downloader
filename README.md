## üõ†Ô∏è How Does It Work?

1. **Enter Spotify Playlist Link**: 
   - Provide a valid Spotify playlist link to the application.

2. **Fetch Tracks**: 
   - The app interacts with the Spotify API to retrieve all the tracks from the provided playlist.

3. **Search YouTube**: 
   - For each track in the playlist, the app performs a search on YouTube and retrieves the top result matching the song title and artist.

4. **Download MP3**: 
   - The app then downloads the audio from the top YouTube result and converts it to MP3 format, saving it locally.

## there is an issue with pytube 15.0.0
so i added cipher.py file, 
replace this with your cipher.py which would be in pytube folder where your python libs are installed
